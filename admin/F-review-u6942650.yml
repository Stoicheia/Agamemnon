comments:
  - Code is well structured and easy to follow
  - Use of separate Node and Scorer classes helpful in clearing clutter of code
  - Follows Java code conventions well, using impressive code style and readibility which is also consistent
  - Passes all tests, which is reassuring
  - Could do with a few extra comments in Scorer to remind readers of the rules of scoring
