# Write a list of review comments here.

comments:
  - Code appears to be a theoretically correct implementation of score maximization and pruning for minimax algorithm
  - Code makes use of GameTree structure, which is an appropriate representation of gamestate that is easy to traverse and manipulate
  - Maximize and minimize functions could be combined into a single function to decrease clutter and make it easier to update algorithm/fix bugs in the future
  - Adheres to Java code conventions and is easy to read despite nested for and if statements
  - The correctness of pruning could be tested by confirming equality with standard minimax bot
  - Code is well commented with description of parameters, though further comments in the body of the function would make it easier to follow, verify correctness and build upon
