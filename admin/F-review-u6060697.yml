comments: 
    - It might be good to add more spacing between operators and identifiers,
        - e.g., `if (tile2.length()!=0) {`
        - could be, `if (tile2.length() != 0) {`
    - line 35 ("tempaction = ...") is a bit long, you might want to split it over multiple lines, 
        - add local variables to make it easier to read.
    - I suspect you could reduce the conditionals starting `if (action1.charAt(1)=='j' && action2.charAt(1)=='j') {`
        - do there really need to be so much code repition? Maybe there does, but it's not clear to me.
    - The code itself is sensible and easy to understand. 
    - You could add a few more explanatory comments.
